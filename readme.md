# Semantic Search Engine for Transcripts

This project is a semantic search engine built using Python 3.9, designed to retrieve transcripts of movies, TV shows, and anime based on user queries. Leveraging the power of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML), this search engine provides an intuitive interface for users to explore and interact with transcript data.

## Features

- **Semantic Search:** Retrieve transcripts based on user queries containing character names or descriptions.
- **Chunking Strategy:** Divide transcripts into chunks to accommodate the limitations of vectorization models.
- **Vector Database:** Utilize ChromaDB, an open-source vector database, for efficient storage and retrieval of transcript vectors.
- **Web Application:** Develop an interactive web application using Streamlit, allowing users to input queries, explore transcripts, and download desired files.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9
- Streamlit
- ChromaDB
- BERT Sentence Transformer
- Other dependencies as listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
